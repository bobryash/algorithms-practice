/**
 * #695
 * <p>
 * You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land)
 * connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are
 * surrounded by water.
 * <p>
 * The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.
 * <p>
 * Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
 * [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
 * [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
 * [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],
 * [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],
 * [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
 * [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
 * [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.
 * (check the picture in a current directory)
